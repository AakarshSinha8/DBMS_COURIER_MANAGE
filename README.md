A courier management system (CMS) is software that helps courier companies handle package deliveries smoothly. It does things like taking orders, assigning them to couriers efficiently, planning the best delivery routes, and letting customers track their packages in real-time. It also helps with tasks like getting proof of delivery and managing billing. Basically, it makes delivering packages easier and more organized for everyone involved.
